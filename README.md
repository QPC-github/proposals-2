# Web Machine Learning - proposals for future work

This repo is a place to share and discuss new proposals to Web-related Machine Learning standards that are not currently in scope of the [Machine Learning for the Web Community Group](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/) or [other W3C groups](https://www.w3.org/groups/).

To share your idea, simply [open a new issue](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/proposals/issues/new?template=new-proposal.md) in this repo. To help get others excited about your proposal, it is helpful if in addition you include the following information in your issue:

>### Proposal name
>Just enough information to be specific and memorable.
>
>### Short description
>One or two paragraphs listing the problem being solved and the target audience for the idea.
>
>### Example use cases
>Two or three examples of an end user with goals and a step-by-step description of how the proposed idea solves helps them achieve the goal.
>
>### A rough idea or two about implementation
>One or two paragraphs about how the feature might be implemented, mostly to help clarify how you're thinking about the problem space and the underlying technologies that could solve the problems.
